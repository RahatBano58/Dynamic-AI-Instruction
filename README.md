# 📝 Dynamic Instructions Exercises (Sunday Homework)

This repository contains **3 exercises** demonstrating how to build **dynamic instruction systems** for AI agents using **Python, Gemini API, and Agentic AI SDK**.  
The agents adapt their behavior based on user context (role, preferences, or profiles).
